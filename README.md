# game-currency-using-EVM-Subnet

Welcome to the DeFi Kingdom Clone project! This README provides an overview of how to set up and deploy your own decentralized finance (DeFi) game using Avalanche and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) technology.

## Set Up Your EVM Subnet

To begin, follow our guide and refer to Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network. This subnet will serve as the foundation for deploying your game's smart contracts and interacting with the Avalanche blockchain.

## Define Your Native Currency

You have the flexibility to define your own native currency for the game. This currency will function as the in-game currency within your DeFi Kingdom clone. Define its tokenomics and distribution model based on your game's mechanics and economic structure.

## Connect to Metamask

Integrate your EVM subnet with Metamask to facilitate user interactions with your game. Follow the steps outlined in our guide to configure Metamask for your custom EVM subnet on Avalanche. This step is crucial for users to interact seamlessly with your decentralized application (dApp).

## Deploy Basic Building Blocks

Utilize Solidity and Remix IDE to deploy the foundational smart contracts for your game. These contracts will define core functionalities such as:

- **Battling:** Smart contracts for player-vs-player (PvP) or player-vs-environment (PvE) battles.
- **Exploring:** Contracts governing exploration mechanics within your game world.
- **Trading:** Smart contracts for trading assets, tokens, or in-game items among players.

These contracts will also establish rules for liquidity pools, token standards (like ERC-20 or ERC-721), and any additional game-specific mechanics.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Setup Environment:** Follow the setup instructions provided in the repository to configure your development environment, including dependencies and tools necessary for smart contract deployment.

3. **Deploy Contracts:** Use Remix or your preferred development environment to deploy the smart contracts located in the `contracts/` directory. Customize these contracts according to your game's specific requirements and mechanics.

4. **Testing and Deployment:** Thoroughly test the deployed contracts in a local or testnet environment to ensure functionality and security. Once satisfied, deploy these contracts to your Avalanche EVM subnet.

5. **Integration:** Integrate frontend interfaces and backend logic to interact with deployed smart contracts. Update Metamask configurations to enable seamless user interaction with your DeFi Kingdom clone.
